 1.PIN should be made up of 4 digits
 2. The Thousand position of PIN should be the digit with maximum frequency. If there are more than one
 digit with max frequency, choose the largest of them
 3. The Hundred position of the PIN should be the digit with minimum frequency. If there are more than
 one digit that occurs with min frequency,choose the smallest of them.
 4. The Tens position should be the largest digit across the three input numbers.
 5. The units position of the PIN should be the smallest digit across the three input numbers.
 Example1:
 input1=1724
 input2=5283
 input3=1937
